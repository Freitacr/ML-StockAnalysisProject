# ML-StockAnalysisProject
Analysis of Stock Patterns using Machine Learning Techniques in a (hopefully) modular way


This project was made through Eclipse, and therefore has all the implications that follow that (as I am currently unaware of the full implications of this, I won't be going into any detail as to what these are). As this is an in-progress project, this README is not designed as a finished, user-friendly product. Therefore, if this is seen by an end user, please raise an issue regarding it. Thank you.
