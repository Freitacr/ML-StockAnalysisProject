In the interest of not repeating information:

See Google's Python Style guide at https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html

Any modifications decided on to their style guide will be listed below:
* As the project is licensed under the MIT License, boilerplate will not be included in each file, for license
restrictions, the project license file is enough.
* The files decision_tree.py, knn.py, and naive_bayes.py are exempt from the style guidelines entirely for the moment.
    * This is because the merit of keeping these files in the project is currently in question, and the effort of
    refactoring them is non-trivial.
